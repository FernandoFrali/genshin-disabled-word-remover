# Genshin "DISABLED" word remover

Our application is designed to remove the "DISABLED" word from .ini files located within subfolders. Additionally, we provide a detailed list of modifications in a .txt file for your convenience. This allows you to easily track and review all changes made to your files.

**Instructions:**

1. Place the program or script inside the main folder containing the subfolders with your mods. For instance, if you have a folder named "mods_genshin" with subfolders like "mods_a" and "mods_b" (`modsgenshin/mods_a` and `modsgenshin/mods_b`), place the program/script inside the "mods_genshin" folder.

2. The program will scan all subfolders within the main folder (excluding the root folder) for `.ini` files that contain the word "DISABLED".

3. Once the program is executed, it will remove all `.ini` files that have the "DISABLED" word from the subfolders.

4. This process works seamlessly for any number of subfolders within the main folder, making it efficient and hassle-free.

5. You can run the program either by executing the Python script directly or by using the provided executable file.
